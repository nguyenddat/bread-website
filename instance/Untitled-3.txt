('2', '../static/img/recipe 2.jpg' ,'Artisan Sourdough Rye Bread', 'This is my favorite rye bread recipe of all time. I could have just as easily called it Swedish Rye Bread or Aroma Therapy Bread for that matter (takes the coveted baking bread smell to another level). And if you’re not into sourdough baking, no problem, I cover the instant yeast version as well.'),

My answer would be, “Ciabatta.” Specifically, sourdough ciabatta, for the added complexity of flavor that natural leavening brings to the bread.'),

('8', '../static/img/recipe 8.jpg' ,'Basic All Purpose Sourdough Bread', 'You can make this basic all purpose flour sourdough bread recipe into beautiful crusty artisan-style bread or a soft and tender sandwich bread. You can choose either a 1-day process baking in the evening or an overnight refrigeration of the dough for a morning bake. It’s simple, easy to follow, and the results are delicious.')
